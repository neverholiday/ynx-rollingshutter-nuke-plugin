**NEED MERGED**
- Build order of "all" in Makefile is wrong, It should be libynxlensdistortionengines.so YnxRollingShutterNode.so.
- Change HUGE to HUGE_VAL because of cmath library changed.

**OPTIONAL**
These change are optional, you can revert back or merge for patching. Mostly it's minor change to make it simplify.
- Add NUKE_INSTALLED_PATH to Makefile for easily modification of nuke path.
- Revise Readme.md because  I added variable. and it should export LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point directory that libynxlensdistortionengines.so is stored.
